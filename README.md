======

esstee is an interpreter, currently under work, for the Structured
Text (ST) programming language. Structured Text is one of the five
languages defined in the IEC-61131-3 standard, and used a lot in the
automation industry.

The aim of esstee is to provide a, "free as in freedom", platform for
building better testing and debug tools for ST applications.
